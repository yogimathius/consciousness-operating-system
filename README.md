# Consciousness Operating System

Integrated platform combining all symbolic, dream, skill, and meaning work

## Project Overview

- **Timeline**: 6+ months (thesis/startup potential)
- **Market Size**: $2B+ personal development market
- **Thesis**: "Personal consciousness as learnable, trackable system"
- **Differentiation**: Only platform combining AI, gamification, and deep symbolism

## Integrated Components

- Dream analysis + Symbol interpretation
- Skill tracking + Philosophy AI
- Life optimization + Flow state management
- Personal data pipeline + Symbolic reasoning engine

## Vision

Create the first comprehensive platform for consciousness development, integrating all individual tools into a unified system for personal growth and self-awareness.

## Long-term Potential

- Research platform for consciousness studies
- Enterprise wellness and development programs
- Educational curriculum for consciousness development
- API platform for consciousness-aware applications

## Current Status

- Vision and product framing are defined.
- Implementation appears incomplete or split across subprojects.
- Operational estimate: **20%** (concept + partial scaffolding).

## Fixme Rationale

- Labeled `_fixme` likely because the integration scope is large and the implementation is not yet cohesive or stable.

## API Endpoints

- Not documented.

## Tests

- Not detected or not run in this audit.

## Future Work

- Define a minimal cohesive MVP and consolidate components.
- Implement a single backend and data model.
- Add end-to-end flows and tests.
